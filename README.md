Simulation studies to test survival analysis of the CIS data to determine duration of positivity.

This code depends on R packages for [running the simulation studies](https://github.com/joshuablake/cisSimulation) and [fitting the models](https://github.com/joshuablake/cisDurationModel), both of which need to be downloaded from GitHub.
The renv environment should automatically install these and the other dependencies.
